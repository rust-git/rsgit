**This is a very preliminary project.** I'm doing this for fun. (Yes, I might be crazy.)

As of this writing (June 2020), I'm relatively new to Rust, but a git enthusiast. I started a [similar project](https://xgit.io) a year ago, but as I've started to explore Rust, I'm finding myself intrigued.

This project may or may not go forward to fruition. For now, I am doing this work in public, but it's not even close to ready to be used.
